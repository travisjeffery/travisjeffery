I'm a Canadian software maker that's hacked on open source projects like Jocko,
Timecop, and Mocha; and built several startups from the ground up, including Segment
and Confluent. 

I've mostly worked at new startups so I've worked on everything:
distributed systems, infrastructure, back-end, front-end, mobile, tooling. I prefer
distributed systems, infrastructure and back-end applied to big data problems.

[I authored a book on building distributed systems using Go, published by Pragmatic Bookshelf.](https://pragprog.com/titles/tjgo/distributed-services-with-go/)
